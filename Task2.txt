Development Proposal: Real-Time
Manufacturing Status Dashboard
Overview
This document outlines a proposal for the development of a real-time manufacturing status
dashboard for Daikibo. This dashboard will provide a centralized view of the health status of
the 9 machines in each of Daikibo’s 4 factories, enabling proactive monitoring and issue
identification. The application will be accessible exclusively within Daikibo's intranet and will
utilize their existing authentication system, providing a secure and seamless user
experience.
Scope
The primary function of this project is to create a single-page dashboard that displays the
real-time status of all 36 monitored machines across Daikibo's four factories. The key
functionalities are:
Machine Status: Each machine's current operational status (e.g., running, idle,
error) will be displayed prominently, reflecting real-time telemetry data.
Factory/Device Hierarchy: The dashboard will utilize a collapsible/expandable
structure, allowing users to view overall factory status and then drill down to
individual machines.
Factory level: Displays aggregated status for all machines within a factory.
Device level: Shows the detailed status of each machine, including a history
of status changes.
Internal Access Only: The application will be accessible only through Daikibo’s
intranet, ensuring data security and privacy.
Integrated Authentication: User authentication will be seamlessly integrated with
Daikibo’s internal authentication server, leveraging existing company accounts.
Single-Page Interface: All functionality will be contained within a single, responsive
web page for ease of use and navigation.
