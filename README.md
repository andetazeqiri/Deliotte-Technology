## Task 1: Data Reconciliation for Daikibo Industrials

We have signed a new account: **Daikibo Industrials**, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals.

Daikibo is in the process of integrating **IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)** devices to monitor, measure, and analyse their manufacturing processes.  

Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half in another. They need assistance in combining the two.

### Objectives
- Help the client **reconcile different data sources**.
- **Combine code into a unified format using Python**.

## Task 2: Real-Time Manufacturing Status Dashboard

Analysing offline data is great, but having a **real-time overview** of processes and **smart alerts** when things break is even better.  

Our client would like us to build a **real-time manufacturing status dashboard**. The first task of this process is **drafting a development proposal**.

The proposal should outline:
- Dashboard features and functionality
- Scope of work
- Estimated man-hours
- Timeline
- Support and maintenance plan
